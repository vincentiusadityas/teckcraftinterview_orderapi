# TeckCraft Technical Test - Order API

This repository contains my solution to the TeckCraft Interview Test - Phase II, where I need to create a simple Order API.

The application is build using Node.JS and Express framework since I think it's the simplest and easiest framework to build a simple RESTful API.

# Getting Started
Assuming youâ€™ve already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  

First, install all of the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can directly run the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ping with your browser to see if the server is running.

You should see the message *You've pinged the server!*
